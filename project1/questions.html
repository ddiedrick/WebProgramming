			<li><b>Which color starts in chess?</b>
				<p>The player with the white pieces always moves first.</p></li> 

				<li><b>Can a pawn move backwards?</b>
					<p>Pawns cannot move backwards. However, when a pawn gets to the other side of the board you must promote it to another piece (such as a queen). Then it moves just like that piece, and can move backwards.</p></li>

					<li><b>Can you move more than one piece at a time in chess?</b>
						<p>You can only move one chess piece at a time when it is your turn to move - with one exception! When you castle, you move both the king and the rook in one move.</p></li>

						<li><b>Which is the most important chess piece?</b>
							<p>The king is the most important chess piece. If you lose the king, you lose the game. But the queen is the most powerful chess piece.</p></li>

							<li><b>
							When was chess invented?</b>
							<p>The origins of chess are not exactly clear, though most believe it evolved from earlier chess-like games played in India almost two thousand years ago.The game of chess we know today has been around since the 15th century where it became popular in Europe.</p></li>

							<li><b>What is the goal of chess?</b>
								<p>Chess is a game played between two opponents on opposite sides of a board containing 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape from capture.</p></li>
